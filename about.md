### Fine I'll Admit It.

CS major, Python coder, Data Analysis & Visualization, Open Source supporter and a Google Developer Group Lead.

I’m passionate about programming, user experience and communities. 

Focused on performance oriented development of web-services and back-end components using Django and other Python-related technologies.

I'm also the guy who'll fix your broken computer. 

I grew up in Srinagar, Kashmir  which is a really beautiful place, even though there’s a really good chance you’ll freeze to death here or get struck by a ~~stray bullet~~.


### Current Status:

I’m currently [available](mailto:zaid@gtugs.org) for hire.
