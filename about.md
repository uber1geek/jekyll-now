### Fine I'll Admit It.

I’m passionate about the web, programming, user experience, customer driven development, whilst continually improving as a community manager.

I'm also the guy who'll fix your broken computer. 

I grew up in Srinagar, Kashmir  which is a really beautiful place, even though there’s a really good chance you’ll freeze to death here or get struck by a ~~stray bullet~~.


### Current Status:

Regional Head - [Google Developers Group Kashmir](http://www.gdgkashmir.com). 

I’m currently [available](mailto:zaid@gtugs.org) for hire.
