There is a good chance that you may have dropped a buttered toast atleast once in your life, you might have observed that the toast always lands the butter side down, creating a greasy mess on your table or the floor. Why does it always land the butter side down? 
Well, a team of researchers from Manchester MET University dropped 100 slices from table and found the [answer](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2410532/Why-toast-falls-butter-Scientists-finally-uncover-reason--height-table.html).

It's Mr.Somersault.

Scientists say toast falls butter side down because it only has time to rotate half a somersault before landing. Well I don't want to go into details of the Butter Toast Theory, my main purpose was to lay emphasis on failure, As you sail though the journey of life, you will realize failure's are evident, dropping the toast on floor is a failure but what do you do after that? you go and make yourself a new one. 
I have failed to pass a test quite a few times during my graduation, primarily due to other occupations and my dis-interest in mainstream academia but then what did i do?

I didn't lose hope, I made the effort to appear again.

As Professor Harold Hill has said — “You pile up enough tomorrows, and you’ll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.”

The most important part of achievement is to start, even though finishing is often thought of as having arrived. It’s so easy to get caught up in wondering about how things will turn out that we lose sight of getting started. Also, if you are always worried about failing, or the obstacles that may come up along the way, this can deter you from even starting. But it is all imaginary thinking because you only know what will really happen when you start moving towards your goal and deal with these challenges as you come upon them.

Be flexible with "not-so-important" details in life. Don't complain about the laptop you have or the internet speed. Always optimise your learning curve.
