When I introduce myself as an engineer, you will mostly get a mental image of someone who is a prodigy at mathematics, someone who crunches and munches numbers and those weird looking symbols for breakfast, Nay! 



I was fairly good with maths ... untill I decided to become an engineer and like most of the average engineerng graduates out there I found mathematics quite unappealing because during our courseware we have never been told about it's practical implementations. I struggled with it during the tenure of my course and only God knows how managed to break through it, the more i started working on those problems, the more I hated it, With hatred, I realized  how it started comming back at me just like karma taking a keen interest into my acquaintanceship.
