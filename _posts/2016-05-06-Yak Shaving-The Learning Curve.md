**Yak Shaving**

> You want to borrow your neighbours hose so that you can wash your car, but you remember last week, you broke their rake, so you need to go to the hardware store to buy a new one and that means driving to the hardware store, you start looking for your keys. You eventually find your keys inside a tear in a cushion - but you can’t leave the cushion torn, because the cat will destroy the cushion if they find a little tear. The cushion needs a little more stuffing before it can be repaired, but it’s a special cushion filled with exotic Tibetan Yak Hair.
The next thing you know, you’re standing on a hillside in Tibet shaving a yak and all you wanted to do was wash your car.
