title: The Learning Curve
---

Literally every day I try to get out of my comfort zone, sometimes I fail, sometimes I get things done and sometimes I end up Yak-Shaving.
Well let's talk about Yak Shaving for a few seconds.

> You want to borrow your neighbours hose so that you can wash your car, but remember last week? You broke their rake, so you need to go to the hardware store to buy a new one and that means driving to the hardware store, Now you start looking for your keys. You eventually find your keys inside a tear in a cushion - but you can’t leave the cushion torn, because the cat will destroy the cushion if they find a little tear. The cushion needs a little more stuffing before it can be repaired, but it’s a special cushion filled with exotic Tibetan Yak Hair.
The next thing you know, you’re standing on a hillside in Tibet shaving a yak and all you wanted to do was wash your car.



**Deliberate Practice**

Thanks to “Outliers” by Malcolm Gladwell, people mistakenly think if they practice something for 10,000 hours they will become great at it.

[Anders Ericsson](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0544456238/?tag=jamesaltuc-20), the professor who first theorized  the 10,000 hour rule, has me corrected  on this. “It’s not practice, but deliberate practice.” He says.

>“You have to have feedback as quickly as possible. 10,000 hours with a teacher, with constant feedback, is critical.”

What better feedback than skateboarding? You skate, you make a mistake, you fall, you bleed. Repeat.
If you don’t get better, you break bones and have to stop. If you learn from your mistakes with the help of teachers, you stop bleeding.

If you don’t get better, you break bones and have to stop. If you learn from your mistakes with the help of teachers, you stop bleeding.
