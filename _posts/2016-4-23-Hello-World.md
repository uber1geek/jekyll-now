The most important part of achievement is to start, even though finishing is often thought of as having arrived. Itâ€™s so easy to get caught up in wondering about how things will turn out that we lose sight of getting started. Also, if you are always worried about failing, or the obstacles that may come up along the way, this can deter you from even starting. But its all imaginary thinking because you only know what will really happen when you start moving towards your goal and deal with these challenges as you come upon them.
